AI: There are no critical objects in the image. The road appears to be empty, with no pedestrians, vehicles, or other obstacles visible.

*Answer*: {"Critical Objects": []}
AI response has been appended to 'try_2.json'
AI: Based on the provided information, the ego vehicle should slow down and change lane to the right due to the presence of a critical object (a pedestrian) on the road ahead. This decision is made to ensure safety by reducing speed and moving away from the potential hazard.

AI: The image displays a straight road with no visible traffic signals or construction cones. The following objects are present in the scene:

*   A white car positioned to the right of the ego vehicle
*   A red car driving towards the ego vehicle from the distance
*   Two individuals walking across the street

AI: Based on the image, the following trajectory-related decisions can be made:

*   The ego vehicle should **slow down** due to the presence of pedestrians and vehicles in close proximity.
*   The ego vehicle should **change lane to the right** to avoid potential collisions with the approaching red car.
